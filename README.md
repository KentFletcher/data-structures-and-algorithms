Place to store code challenges
I will be doing daily code challenges and will include the names of the people I work with and who help me.
- For challenge 1, I was paired with Paul Depew. I also received help from other students on Discord, mainly Peyton on answers 4 and 5, and also Joseph and Robert.  
- For challenge 2, I worked with Ken Harman, and Paul Depew assisted us on challenge 5.
